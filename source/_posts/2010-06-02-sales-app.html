<p>Today we presented an internal application for our sales division. This application is intended to support our sales division on the road and is intended to run on the iPhone. We created the application within two weeks. During these two weeks, a noticed again that it is hard to get access to all the information you need and in the way you need it.</p>

<p>Lets create more apps! Anyone any suggestions?</p>
