<p>Currently I&#8217;m sitting on the bench. Meaning I don&#8217;t have an assignment for my work. So I&#8217;m sitting at the office doing, well not much. I finished an e-course with the title &#8216;Creating a positive attitude&#8217; because of the name. To kill some time I went to the sauna, no problems there. Hopefully I&#8217;ll get an assignment soon.</p>
