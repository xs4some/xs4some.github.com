<p>Today I bought a console, a PlayStation 3 to be precise.Â  I wanted a console which is capable of playing nextgen DVD&#8217;s. The Wii doesn&#8217;t have a nextgen player, and the 360 has a HD-DVD which has only a few supporters left.</p>

<p>I bought two games: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin's_Creed" title="Assassin's Creed">Assassin&#8217;s Creed</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TimeShift_(video_game)" title="TimeShift">Timeshift</a>. AC looks really good, I hope I don&#8217;t finish it to fast. I haven&#8217;t looked at TS yet, I will do that when I&#8217;m stuck or bored with AC.</p>

<p>Has anyone any game suggestions? I&#8217;d be glad to hear them!</p>
