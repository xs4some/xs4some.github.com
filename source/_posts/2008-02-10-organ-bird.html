<p>Today we went to a concert of <a href="http://www.capellagroningen.nl" title="Capella Groningen">Capella Groningen</a>, we used to sing there. It was good to see them again. To fill up some time, the concert was accompanied by some organ works by English composers. The organ made a strange whistling sound when the organ player turned on the stars on the organ.</p>

<p>The console really kicks ass, well actually Assassin&#8217;s Creed does. I can&#8217;t wait to continue playing the game, but first we have to work for another week.</p>
