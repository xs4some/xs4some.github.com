<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;ll be visiting a local Scouting group called <a href="http://www.drmoller.nl/">Dr. Moller</a>.</p>

<p>As I have been a cup scout leader for some year, but since we moved I stoped. The traveltime was outragious (two-and-a-half hours for a single trip)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a little bit exited, as I have no idea what kind of group this is. Also there&#8217;s not a real address to be found, only some vague direction. Hopefully they&#8217;ll get me there :D</p>
