<p>As you all know, pictures say more then words.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hbruinsma/sets/72157617550652347/"><img height="375" width="500" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3575/3496664347_1c5ca275e7.jpg?v=0" title="Skydive" class="alignnone"/></a></p>
<p>As you might expect, it was awesome! When we jumped out of the <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en-gb&amp;um=1&amp;sa=1&amp;q=cessna+ph-des&amp;btnG=Search+Images&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=">airplane</a>, we started the free fall with some rolls. After those rolls we continued a ‘normal’ free fall. Unfortunately, the free fall was ended very soon “ time flies, you know “ and we started our descent to the Marklin like playground with Dutch trains on it.</p>
<p>If you ever get the change to jump, do it! It’s awesome!</p>
