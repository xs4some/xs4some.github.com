<p>Because we can&#8217;t take our cat tot the hotel she is staying with my wife&#8217;s mother, until we can take her to our new home. Today we visited her. It was good to see her again, she looked good. Although she is getting a little fat, she looked happy and content. The last time we visited her, she gave us the cold shoulder. My wife really misses her, and can&#8217;t wait showing her the newly bought garden for her.</p>
