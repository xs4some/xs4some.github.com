Finally <abbr title="Fiber to the Home">FttH</abbr>!


Just a week or so, and then they'll finaly put fiber in our streets. I can't wait to finaly have a proper internet connection (with symetric speeds).


My current connection runs over the cable network provided by [Ziggo](http://www.ziggo.nl), which is better then any ADSL connection I can get here, but it's still not very good. The problem is probably due to the cable sharing with the neighbours, or water in the cable.
