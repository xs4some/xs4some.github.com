<p>At eight o&#8217;clock this morning the movers came, and filled up the truck with our stuff. After an hour or two, we left our old address and started our journey to the south. As always in the Netherlands, the roads were crowded and during our trip we had some time to pick our noses. After a good length of time, we arrived at our new home and we could start emptying the truck. At three the movers left, and we had a house full of boxes. I think we can see the end of the moving thing very soon!</p>
