<p>Today we went to a company which has a product to quickly deploy mobile application over five platforms. It look very promising, although there are some drawbacks. Because the application is party deployed as a web application, the applications don&#8217;t respond as quickly as you&#8217;d like. But on the other side, you can create application very quickly.</p>
