<p>O yeah, one of my favourite activities. Driving in a traffic jam.<br/>
Last Tuesday, I had to go to our capital city to update a web-server and to place a new one in the data centre.<br/>
It took me three hours and fifteen minutes to get there. It normally takes about one and an half hour.<br/>
The car I was driving in, was equipped with a navigation system. Which showed me suburbs of our capital city, by the means of a scenery tour.</p>
