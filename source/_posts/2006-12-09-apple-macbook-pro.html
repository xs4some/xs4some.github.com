<p>After having an Apple PowerMac G5 for almost two years now, I definitely want a new one. Partly because the machine is getting less and less fast. This is very annoying when I play World of Warcraft.<br/>
Maybe an update of my graphics card will be enough, but I wouldn&#8217;t mind getting a whole new computer on my Desk.</p>
