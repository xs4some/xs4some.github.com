<p>Carnival has its pros and its cons. The road is almost mine, compared to the normal crowd. It saves me about fifteen minutes on every trip from and to my work, I could also park my car closer to the gate to enter the ground of the client. On the other hand, we couldn&#8217;t even go eat in the hotel because it was to crowded. Instead we ordered pizza on our hotel room. Good thing the reception didn&#8217;t whine about order pizza on the hotel room.</p>

<p>Idd prefer being normal again, so I can just eat peacefully without awkward dressed people. Only a few more days left, and then the 40 days before Easter starts. During that time I don&#8217;t eat meat, liquorice, chocolate nor shall I drink alcoholic beverages.</p>
