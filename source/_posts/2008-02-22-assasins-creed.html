<p>This morning I finished the game Assassin&#8217;s Creed on my PS3. What a crappy end. You expect from a series, that one part will have some form of ending. But this is just like a chapter in a book. To many questions to be answered. Hopefully they&#8217;ll release part two soon enough, I can&#8217;t wait.</p>

<p>Has anyone an idea for my next game? I already have TimeShift, but it sucks.</p>
