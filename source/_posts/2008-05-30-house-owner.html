<p>From this moment of, we are house owners (and debtees). We just signed the deed for the house and a deed for the mortgage. The only thing we have to do next is painting all de seeling, walls, and laying a some floor coverage on the first floor. Good thing my father and my father in law are going to help us with the painting and a friend and his father are going to help to put the floor coverage on the first floor in.</p>

<p>We have to hurry, because we have until the 20th to get everything doneâ€¦</p>
