<p>Although working long days takes a lot of energy, I think we learn a lot of it.</p>

<p>Yesterday I even went to the sports center. We played hockey. Well, to be honest, air hockey.</p>

<p>Haven&#8217;t done anything besides the work.</p>

<p>This weekend I&#8217;ll be going to DC with a group. I hope this will be fun!</p>

<p>Well, I&#8217;m of for sports.</p>

<p>See ya!</p>
