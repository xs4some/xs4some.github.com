<p>What a turn-off, the broker called to say the house we were supposed to visit was sold. I just can&#8217;t wait to move, the traveling is breaking me up.</p>

<p>But then again, the hotel living has its advantages. My bed is made every morning, freshly made orange-juice, eating out every day, and so on. But when you get back to your hotel room. There&#8217;s nothing to do. You&#8217;re just bound to that room. No friends visiting, and no other extra curricular activities.</p>
