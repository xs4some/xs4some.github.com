<p>So that was christmas. What have I done.
Well, let&#8217;s summarize:
</p><ul><li>Christmas eve, I went to a Christmas eve concert of <a href="http://www.capellafrisiae.nl/">Capella Frisiae</a>, which was very good. Without a conductor even!</li>
<li>On the Christmas day we went to my to-be-mother-in-law where we sat, ate, spoke, ate and ate.</li>
<li>On boxing day we went to my parents, with whom we went to see the grave of my grandmother, (she died in may this year) visited my sugar-aunt (not be mistaken by a sugar daddy) and ate.</li>
<li>As far as can be spoken of a third day of Christmas, we had a diner with the Scouting organization of the village a come from. Which was very nice.</li>
</ul><br/>
As you can see, it was a busy Christmas!
