<p>Today we ate at the <a href="http://www.olympiawaalre.nl/" title="olympia">Greek</a> in Waalre. In the south, the celebrate carnival. People really dress-up awkward a girl was dressed up as a dog, a dalmatian, with a mask for the ears and her nose.  Good thing we know what he serves, so we didn&#8217;t need to see the menu to order. The food there is realy good, and Greeks always server more then you can eat.</p>
