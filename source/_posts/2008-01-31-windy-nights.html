<p>I just finished a tasty meal with a colleague, and now I&#8217;m in my room again. Alone tonight, due to the <a title="Windy nights" href="http://www.lone-star.net/mall/literature/rls/WindyNights.htm">windy nights</a> my fianc√© is stuck on Heathrow airport. Hopefully I will see her tonight, but it will probably be very late.  One more night and then its weekend, but I won&#8217;t be home by Saturday, because tomorrow it&#8217;s my sister-in-law her birthday and we are going to visit her. Pooh, now I think of it, Saturday evening we are going to a concert. No spare time, sitting home, doing nothing but watching the telly. Hopefully soon that evening may come.  I think I may need a vacation soon. The long days are eating me up. No idea yet of were I should go. But I wouldn&#8217;t mind going to a warmer place.</p>
