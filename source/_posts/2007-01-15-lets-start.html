<p>Today we started our course. We didn&#8217;t do much really, the staff introduced them self in we got a little assignment. And, not the least, a laptop to do our assignments on.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we had a drink and a snack with the staff and our colleagues.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still tired, so I&#8217;m of to bed in a sec.</p>
