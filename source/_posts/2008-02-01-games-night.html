<p>Tonight we went with my sister-in-law to a games night of her new work. We had a lot of fun, I played some poker and played the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SingStar" title="Singstar">Singstar</a> on a PSP2. Singstar was fun, but the most songs were a little bit high-pitched, as I am a baritone.</p>

<p>It was good to see an open, multicultured company.</p>
