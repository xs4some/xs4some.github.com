<p>This morning I noticed that our beloved railway company have changed their time table. The only problem is that I noticed it after the train that I had wanted to take, had already left. Could it get any worse? I have to get up half an hour earlier, and it is no longer possible to catch the bus I need to take to get to my destinationâ€¦ Why did <em>we</em> privatise public transportation?</p>
