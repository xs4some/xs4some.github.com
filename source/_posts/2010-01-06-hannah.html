<p>On monday January 4 on 9.40, our daughter Hannah was born. She came into this world by an SC. Mother and doughter have to remain in the hospital, so my wife can recover from the SC.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to the city hall to register her birth. Her full name is Hannah Judith Hester Geartsje.</p>
