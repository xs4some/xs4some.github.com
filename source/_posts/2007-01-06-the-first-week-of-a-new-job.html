<p>It has been a long and energy-eating week, but I&#8217;m very glad about my choice to work for Sogeti. Not much to tell though, but if you need a reliable company with carreer possibilities, go for Sogeti!<br/>
Next week I will need to study and Saturday January 13 we will be flying to Athens Ohio, for a training.<br/>
The only downside is, that all the training will be in Vianen. So another week in a hotel away from home without my GF.</p>
