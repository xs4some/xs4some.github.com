<p>It has been a while, but halfway March I started on a real assignment.Â I&#8217;m now programming on a mainframe system for a bank. Old black and green screens is what I work with al day. You start wondering when they start using <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic">real</span>Â systemsâ€¦Â Only a few more weeks, and my holiday start. From the 11th of July until the last day of July, I&#8217;ll be on my holiday. This year we&#8217;re going to France. No exact planning yet, but it&#8217;ll be something like this.Â Â </p>
