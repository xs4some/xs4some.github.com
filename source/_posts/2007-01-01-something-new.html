<p>Today something new started. Not only a new year, but my new job also started today. Although I actualy begin tomorrow, because January first is a holiday.<br/>
This afternoon I&#8217;ll be traveling to Vianen, where I will stay the whole week. The purpose of the first week is getting to know Sogeti.<br/>
I can say, I&#8217;m kindoff excited.</p>
