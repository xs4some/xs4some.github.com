<p>Since the seventeenth of December I have an assignment in Roosendaal, which is located in the southern parts of the Netherlands. We are now looking for a house in Tilburg, because most of the clients of my current department are located here.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we are going to see a house for the second time, hopefully it hasn&#8217;t been sold yet!</p>
