<p>Last week I got connected by a new <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr>, but my phone number wasn&#8217;t ported yet. This weekend I struggled to get it working on my old router. I wanted to use the old one, because the ease of use and also because the new router couldn&#8217;t be mounted on the wall.</p>

<p>After some struggle, I managed to log in VOIP service, only after calling the line was dropped. My router didn&#8217;t have the necessary codec to &#8216;talk&#8217; with the VOIP server. The standard router software didn&#8217;t have the codec, but my old provider has software for the router on their site which has the necessary code. Now I can finaly call for free within The Netherlands.</p>
