<p>Today we went to the summer camp location of the Martinistam. (Sorry, can&#8217;t say anything more. Because the location is always a secret.)</p>

<p>In this village we ate and went to the tourist office. Although it was closed, the lady saw our weeping faces and give us some information. We had a lot of fun, the village we visited was a little bit over-christian. We wanted to rent something on a Sunday, but they wouldn&#8217;t let us because of the village people.</p>

<p>After we checked out the cabin we will rent during the camp, we visited an odd named village we saw on the map. Unfortunatly I can&#8217;t post the picture we took of the name plate of this village.</p>
