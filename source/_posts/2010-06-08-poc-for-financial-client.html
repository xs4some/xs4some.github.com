<p>For this morning, we had an appointment with a financial client to create a POC for the iPhone, iPad and BlackBerry devices. The iPhone and iPad applications where quickly deployed, but the BlackBerry gave us some trouble. Although this was solved hours before the deadline. For now, we wait.</p>
