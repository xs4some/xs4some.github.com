<p>Although I try to regularly update this weblog, I can&#8217;t find time to do this.</p>

<p>The last few weeks I visited an other company which creates uniform mobile application. Looking back at the previous <a href="http://www.xs4some.nl/archives/hobbies/apple/multiplatform-mobile-solutions">company</a> we visited, this company is miles ahead of them. The applications run smoothly and look like they have been created specially for the platform it runs in. Also the development tools are more mature, as they use proven technologies like the IDE <a href="http://eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>.</p>

<p>We also worked on some proposals for client in several sectors and created a POC.</p>

<p>It looks like the internal mobile project will be launched anytime soon! I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on the new hardware we ordered. I just have to be patientâ€¦</p>
