<p>After being a customer of <a href="http://xs4all.nl">XS4all</a> for several years, the difference in speed was getting larger and larger. And they didn't add anything to make the loss of speed nor the extra costs worth while. So we switched back to <a href="http://ziggo">Ziggo</a>. It is realy nice to have a reasonable speed!</p>
<p>Also the digital TV XS4all provided, still is a hassle as all TV's still realy on cable and need a STB to work.</p>
