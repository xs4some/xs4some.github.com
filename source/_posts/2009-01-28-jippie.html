<p>Woehoe!<br/>
As you may have read, I&#8217;ve sold my old macbook Pro yesterday. And today I noticed that shop called <em>Mediamarkt</em> has an action that all laptops are sold VAT free. In the Netherlands, that means a 19% discount.<br/>
Unfortunately, the version I wanted to buy was sold out. (The cheapest version of the macbook pro) And thus I bought the midrange version of the 15.4&#8221; macbook pro!</p>
