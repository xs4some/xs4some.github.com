<p>So, the first week is over. It has been a hardworking week, I&#8217;ve learned a lot.</p>

<p>Good to hear that if it where for real, they wouldn&#8217;t mind sending us to present the idea to the company for real. That&#8217;s good to hear!</p>

<p>This afternoon we will be driving to DC. I&#8217;m looking forward to that!</p>
