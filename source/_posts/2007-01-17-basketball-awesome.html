<p>I never have liked to watch sports, but this was awesome! At first a was a little skeptic, but it was real fun! There where some guys in front of us, from the O-zone (the fan club of the Ohio Bobcats), and they explained us what we should do.</p>

<p>First the visiting team had to be introduced, we had to turn our back to them, and read a news paper. Every time a team member was introduced, we had to cheer &#8216;sucks!&#8217;.</p>

<p>When the game started there was a lot of cheering involved, but that&#8217;s OK. To try out the crowd, the cheerleaders started to give away some pizza&#8217;s to the hardest cheering folks. As you can guess, I was one of the one to get a pizza!</p>

<p>At the end of the game, they started pointing at the teams bases and cheering &#8216;winning team&#8217; and &#8216;loosing team&#8217;. Of course, with the help of our hard cheering, the Bobcats won.</p>

<p>&#8220;Winning team!&#8221;</p>
