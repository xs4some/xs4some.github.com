I've waited long for it, but &#8220;Fiber is coming&#8222;!

Only one street away, and on Friday the will start putting fiber in our street! Can't to finaly have a proper connection and leave an era of cable behind me.

When I first got cable internet (1999), it was a bliss! Internet for a fixed price a month! It has been a lot of years, and still cable isn't offering symetric connections.
