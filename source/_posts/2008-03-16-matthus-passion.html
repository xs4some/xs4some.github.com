<p>Yesterday evening we went to the Matthäus Passion of Johann Sebastian Bach. It was performed by <a title="Capella Frisiae" href="http://www.capellafrisiae.eu">Capella Frisiae</a> and accompanied by <a title="Concerto d'Amsterdam" href="http://www.concertodamsterdam.nl/">Concerto d&#8217;Amsterdam</a> and directed by Hoite Pruiksma. It was the first time CF did the MP. Normally we sing it with the Noordkoor. As always the orchestra was marvelless. The soloist where also very good. Although I prefer an Altus instead of an Alt. Andreas Scholl for instance is a very nice to hear Altus.</p>
